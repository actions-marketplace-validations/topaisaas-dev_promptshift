/**
 * PromptShift X (Twitter) Annual Catalog Builder — v3 "Marketing & CTA" edition
 *
 * Tone: simple, direct, commercial English. Every main tweet ends with a clear
 * call-to-action ("Link in the reply 👇", "See link in bio", ...). The main tweet
 * itself never contains a URL (keeps full X reach, also when reposted by
 * @jeanyvesgarcin). The auto-reply carries the offer + https://promptshift.dev.
 *
 * Posts already broadcast (listed in data/x_posts_history.json) are preserved
 * verbatim at the top of the catalog so the autopilot resumes at the next slot.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/build_annual_x_catalog.ts
